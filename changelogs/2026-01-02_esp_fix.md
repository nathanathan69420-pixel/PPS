### Violence District
- **Fixed Generator ESP:** 
    - Added a dropdown to select between **Highlight** and **Box** ESP types.
    - Highlights now feature customizable colors and are visible through walls (**AlwaysOnTop**).
    - Box mode provides a clear 2D bounding box without distracting text labels.
- **Fixed Box ESP:** Re-implemented the bounding box calculation using a 8-point projection method for perfect alignment.
- **Killer & Survivor ESP:** Replaced text labels with team-based highlights (Crimson for Killers, Deep Blue for Survivors).
- **Chams:** Added a color picker to the Chams toggle (default: White).
- **UI Improvements:** 
    - Updated window titles and other text elements to reflect the `.lua` extension change.
    - Names are now automatically hidden when highlighting (Chams, Killer ESP, or Survivor ESP) is enabled.

### Other Scripts
- Standardized file extensions and updated internal UI titles (e.g., `BlindShot.lua`).
- Improved generic bypass functions for `VirtualInputManager` and `HttpService`.
